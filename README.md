# Important Note
Texture packs that contain errors will carry over those errors to the pack when ported. The best I could do is try to automatically fix them but I can only do so much to prevent these potential errors from happening. Regardless this software will save hours of manual work even if a minute or two is required to make a slight patch if a ported pack does contain errors.
